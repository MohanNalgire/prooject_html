                <p>
                    A wiki is an online hypertext publication collaboratively edited and managed by its own audience,
                    using a web browser. A typical wiki contains multiple pages for the subjects or scope of the
                    project, and could be either open to the public or limited to use within an organization for
                    maintaining its internal knowledge base.

                    Wikis are enabled by wiki software, otherwise known as wiki engines. A wiki engine, being a form of
                    a content management system, differs from other web-based systems such as blog software, in that the
                    content is created without any defined owner or leader, and wikis have little inherent structure,
                    allowing structure to emerge according to the needs of the users.[1] Wiki engines usually allow
                    content to be written using a simplified markup language and sometimes edited with the help of a
                    rich-text editor.[2] There are dozens of different wiki engines in use, both standalone and part of
                    other software, such as bug tracking systems. Some wiki engines are free and open-source, whereas
                    others are proprietary. Some permit control over different functions (levels of access); for
                    example, editing rights may permit changing, adding, or removing material. Others may permit access
                    without enforcing access control. Other rules may be imposed to organize content.

                    There are hundreds of thousands of wikis in use, both public and private, including wikis
                    functioning as knowledge management resources, note-taking tools, community websites, and intranets.
                    Ward Cunningham, the developer of the first wiki software, WikiWikiWeb, originally described wiki as
                    "the simplest online database that could possibly work".[3] "Wiki" (pronounced [wiki][note 1]) is a
                    Hawaiian word meaning "quick".[4][5][6]

                    The online encyclopedia project Wikipedia is the most popular wiki-based website, and is one of the
                    most widely viewed sites in the world, having been ranked in the top twenty since 2007.[7] Wikipedia
                    is not a single wiki but rather a collection of hundreds of wikis, with each one pertaining to a
                    specific language. The English-language Wikipedia has the largest collection of articles: as of
                    February 2020, it has over 6 million articles.
